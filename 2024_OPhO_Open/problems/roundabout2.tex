\begin{problem}
{\textbf{\textsc{Roundabout 2}}} While the block is going around the circular track, it is given a small push perpendicular to its current velocity and parallel to the surface of the track, causing it to oscillate with period $T$. What is the smallest possible value of $T$ when $d = 5\;\mathrm{m}$?
