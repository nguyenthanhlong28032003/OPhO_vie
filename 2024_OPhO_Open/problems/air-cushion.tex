\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Air Cushion}}}
An air cushion is in the shape of a cylinder with length $\ell=10.0\;\mathrm{m}$ and circular cross-sectional radius $R=28\;\mathrm{cm}$. The ends of the cylinder lie in vertical planes, and the length lies parallel to the horizontal ground. It is filled with an incompressible gas. Both the surface of the air cushion and gas inside have negligible weight compared to other forces in the scenario. The surface maintains a a constant surface tension $\gamma=5.0\;\mathrm{N/m}$ whenever deformed. A flat slab of mass $m=12.0\;\mathrm{kg}$ which is wider than the cushion is balanced on top, squishing the cushion. Find the new horizontal width of the cushion. Assume that its cross-section remains symmetric about a vertical axis.
