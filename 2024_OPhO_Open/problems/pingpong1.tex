\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Ping-pong 1}}} A legal serve in ping-pong requires that the ball bounces on one side of the table and that the ball goes over the net. A certain world-class Olympic ping-pong player does the serve at the level of the table at a distance $d=1.37\;\mathrm{m}$ from the net of height $h=15.25\;\mathrm{cm}$. The Olympic player can give the ball such a spin that the translational speed of the ball is conserved after a bounce but the direction of velocity can be controlled freely. What is the minimal serving speed $v_1$ (up to two decimal places)?
