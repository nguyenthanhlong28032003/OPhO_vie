\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Solenoid Spring}}\hspace{1mm}}
A solenoid also functions as a spring of spring constant $k=50\;\mathrm{N/m}$. It is connected in series with a resistor of very small resistance. One end of the solenoid is firmly fixed to its wire while the other end has a conducting ring of mass $m=0.25\;\mathrm{kg}$ that is free to frictionlessly slide on its wire but always remains in contact. The inductance is $L_0=3.0\;\mathrm{mH}$ at its relaxed length $\ell_0=20\;\mathrm{cm}$. If the free end of the solenoid is slightly displaced, find the angular frequency of the resulting oscillations. The initial current through the circuit is $I=8\;\mathrm{A}$. Assume that the thermal power lost by the resistor is negligible.
