\begin{problem}

\textbf{\textsc{Jaywalking}} You are a jaywalker at a distance $x=8.00\;\mathrm{m}$ from an intersection. At time $t = 0$ you start to cross it at a constant velocity perpendicular to the direction of the street such that it would take you time $T$ to cross it. Incidentally, at $t = 0$, there is also a car at $X = 40.0\;\mathrm{m}$ away from the intersection on the same side as you. It is a self-driving Tesla, and it drives toward the intersection at such a speed that if the light remained green, the car would reach the intersection at $t = T$.

At time $t = 0$, the light turns red, and since the car is driven by a computer, it immediately begins decelerating with constant acceleration a such that it comes to a stop at exactly $X = 0$.

Do you get hit by the car? If yes, report the speed of the car relative to the ground when it hits you, as a percent of its original speed before the light turned red. If no, report how far away the car is from you when you finish crossing the street.
