\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Ping-pong 2}}} We consider a serve with $n$ bounces before going over the net. The Olympic player is so incredibly good that he can control the direction of the velocity after each bounce as he pleases. Naturally more bounces decreases the minimal serving speed $v_n$. However, for some $N$, when $n\geq N$ the minimal serving speed no longer decreases if bounces are added, i.e. $N$ is the smallest natural number such that $v_m=v_N$ for all $m\geq N.$ Find $v_{N-1}^N$.
