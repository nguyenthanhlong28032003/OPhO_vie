\begin{problem}
{\textbf{\textsc{Cannonball}}} On flat ground, a cannonball is shot with a speed of $v=13.3\;\mathrm{m/s}$ over a wall of height $h=5\;\mathrm{m}$ located a distance $d=10\;\mathrm{m}$ away from the cannon. If $x_{\max}$ is the farthest away the ball can be shot over the wall and $x_{\min}$ is the shortest distance the ball can reach while going over the wall, find $x_{\max}-x_{\min}$.
