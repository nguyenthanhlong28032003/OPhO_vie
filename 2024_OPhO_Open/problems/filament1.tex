\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Filament 1}}\hspace{1mm}}
Follin has developed a revolutionary new lightbulb filament. The filament is in the shape of a spherical shell of radius 3 cm and thickness 0.5 mm, and the ends of the filament are diametrically opposite. To attach the wires, the filament is slightly flattened on the ends, forming two circles of radius 0.01 mm, each of which is completely covered by the corresponding contact wire. If the resistivity of the filament material is $0.050\;\mathrm{\Omega\cdot m}$, what is the resistance of Follin's lightbulb?.
