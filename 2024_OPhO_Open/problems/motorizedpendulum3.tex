\begin{problem}
\textbf{\textsc{Motorized Pendulum 3}}
The pendulum initially is at $\theta=0$. The mass contains extremely sensitive electronics that cannot tolerate speeds above $v_{max}=0.1000\;\mathrm{m/s}$. To three significant figures, what is the minimum value of $\tau_0$ needed so that the pendulum reaches $\theta=90^{\circ}$ without exceeding this speed threshold?
