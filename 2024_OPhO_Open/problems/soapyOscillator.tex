\begin{problem}
{\textbf{\textsc{Soapy oscillator}}} On a smooth table lies a square frame made of four homogeneous rods of length $\ell=50\;\mathrm{cm}$ and mass $m=150\;\mathrm{g}$ which are hinged together at the corners. Each (massless) hinge carries a charge $q=1.5\cdot10^{-6}\;\mathrm{C}$. Before the frame was put on the table, it was put in a liquid soap mixture which left a soap film within the frame defined by the rods. The surface tension of said soapy water is $\sigma=0.035\;\mathrm{N/m}$. It turns out that it is possible to have small amplitude oscillations where opposing corners of the frame have opposite velocities (away/towards from the centre). What is the respective angular frequency of the oscillations?
