\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{A Tired Flappy Bird}}} A \href{https://flappybird.io/}{flappy bird} can jump multiple times in the air. Each time it jumps mid-air, it can suddenly change its speed and direction. For every jump, the bird can decide when to jump and in which direction. Between jumps, the bird falls freely under gravity, which pulls it down at the acceleration $g$. Say, our tired flappy bird starts off the cliff of height $H$ with the jumping velocity $V[1]=V_0$. Subsequent jumps in mid-air have decreasing velocities, i.e. the $n$-th jump has speed $V[n]=V_0/n$ ($n>1$). This majestic Vietnamese animal wants to travel as far as possible horizontally before it lands on the ground. Find the maximum horizontal distance the bird can travel (denoted as $L$ in the figure below) in meters, given that $H=100$m and $V_0=10$m/s. \textit{Note that each jumping velocity is the total speed of the bird after the jump (rather than e.g. adding to its speed before the jump).}
