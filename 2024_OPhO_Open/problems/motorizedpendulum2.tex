\begin{problem}
\textbf{\textsc{Motorized Pendulum 2}}
The pendulum initially is at $\theta=0$. This time, the mass is not so sensitive. The motor may supply its full torque for all $\theta$. What is the minimum value of $\tau_0$ needed so that the pendulum reaches $\theta=90^{\circ}$ in a single unidirectional swing?
