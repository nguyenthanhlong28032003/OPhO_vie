\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Electric Slide}}} 
Consider a gas of small particles, each with charge $q$, inside an origin-centered spherical chamber of radius $R$. A uniform electric field $E\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is applied inside the chamber. The field is adjusted until point $(R,0,0)$ has pressure $P_0$ and point $(-R,0,0)$ has pressure $P_0/2$ (at equilibrium). 

The electric field is quickly decreased to zero, and the gas comes to equilibrium again. If the final pressure in the chamber is $P_1$, find $P_1/P_0$. Neglect interactions between particles and assume that the temperature of the gas remains nearly constant.
