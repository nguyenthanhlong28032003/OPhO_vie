\begin{problem}
{\textbf{\textsc{A Question of Counting}}} A uniform beam of cold neutrons (neutrons have mass $m=1.67\times {10}^{-27}\;\mathrm{kg}$ and speed $v=0.66\;\mathrm{m/s}$) passes through a thin slit of width $d=0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$. A detector, of width $w=3$ cm, is placed a distance $r=15\;\mathrm{m}$ from the slit. Find the percentage of neutrons passing through the slit that are actually recorded by the detector.
