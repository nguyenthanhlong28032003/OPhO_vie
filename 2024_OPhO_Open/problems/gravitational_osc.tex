\textbf{\textsc{Gravitational Oscillations 1}}
%There has been a sad trend in the last decade where more and more people reject basic science and start believing that the earth is flat. While the earth is obviously round, the challenges in making Newtonian gravitation work in a flat world are interesting. So let's have fun at the expense of flat earthers.
You are given the charge distribution on a conductive ellipsoid described by the equation 
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1
\]
If we denote its total charge by \(q\), the surface charge density \(\sigma\) is given by
\begin{equation*}
\sigma = \frac{q}{4\pi abc} \left( \frac{x^2}{a^4} + \frac{y^2}{b^4} + \frac{z^2}{c^4} \right)^{-1 / 2}
\label{ellipsoidCharge}
\end{equation*}
Now suppose we model a planet as a uniform density disk. The issue with this is that everyone at the edges would be pulled towards the center (not ``downwards''). In what follows, suppose that the disk has a fixed radius \(R\) and a height \(h \ll R\). This comes at the cost that different people feel different gravitational ``constants'' downward. Consider the density distribution of the disk \(\rho = \rho(r)\) such that people living on it would only feel a gravitational pull downwards. What is the ratio $\rho(\frac{R}{3})/\rho(\frac{2R}{3})$?
