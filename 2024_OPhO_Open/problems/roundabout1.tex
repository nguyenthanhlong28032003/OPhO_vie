\begin{problem}
{\textbf{\textsc{Roundabout 1}}} A ramp with length $d$ is raised an angle $\theta$ ($0^{\circ} < \theta < 90^{\circ}$) above the horizontal. A block with mass $m$ is placed at the top of the ramp, with the coefficient of friction between the block and the ramp being $\mu$. Once the block reaches the bottom of the ramp, it retains its velocity as it is smoothly transitioned onto a frictionless circular track with radius $d$ and bank angle $\theta$, rotating on the track without sliding off. A \emph{solution} is a set of values $\{d, \mu, \theta\}$ that result in the situation described above. What is the largest $\theta$ (in degrees) for which a solution exists?
