\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Atom Smasher}}}
An alpha particle is the nucleus of a $^4\text{He}$ atom, and is composed of two protons and two neutrons bound together. A neutron is given speed $v$ and collides with an alpha particle at rest. If all five protons and neutrons become unbound as a result of the collision, what is the minimum possible value of $v/c$? You may find the following values useful:
$$m_p = 938.27\text{ MeV}/c^2,\quad m_n = 939.57\text{ MeV}/c^2,\quad m_{\alpha} = 3727.4\text{ MeV}/c^2$$
