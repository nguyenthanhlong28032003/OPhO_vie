\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Dying Light}}} Follin creates a vat of a peculiar liquid with index of refraction $n = 1 + i(1\cdot 10^{-6}).$ Just a bit complex. While working with the liquid, he accidentally drops a photodetector into it. Follin shines a red laser with wavelength $\lambda=700\;\text{nm}$ and vacuum intensity $I_0 = 5\cdot 10^{6}\;\mathrm{W/m^2}$ down into the liquid. How far does the photodetector sink before it detects an intensity less than $I_f = 10^{-10}\;\mathrm{W/m^2}$? Assume that the lab is completely dark and that the laser light is perfectly transmitted into the liquid.
