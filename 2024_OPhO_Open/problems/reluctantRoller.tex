\begin{problem}{\textsc{\textbf{Reluctant Roller}}}
A hoop of mass $m$ and radius $r$ rests on a surface with coefficient of friction $\mu$. At time $t=0$, a string is attached to the hoop's highest point and a constant horizontal tension $T$ is applied. By time $t$, the hoop has rotated by angle $\theta(t)$. What is the minimum value of $\displaystyle\frac{T}{\mu mg}$ such that $\theta(t)$ has a local maximum (i.e., is not strictly increasing)? You may need to graph an implicit function.
