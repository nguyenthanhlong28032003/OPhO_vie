\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textsc{Into Orbit}}} A cannon is fixed to the top of a platform of height $R = 6.00 \times 10^6\;\mathrm{m}$, which sits on a planet of mass $M = 6.00 \times 10^{24}\;\mathrm{kg}$ and radius $R$. Both the cannon and the platform it rests on have negligible mass, and the cannon's chamber is angled horizontally relative to the planet below it. The cannon then fires a cannonball of with mass $m = 45\;\mathrm{kg}$ through a chamber of length $l=3\;\mathrm{m}$ at a constant acceleration such that the cannonball is able to successfully enter an elliptical orbit around the planet. What is the minimum force that must be applied by the cannon on the cannonball in order to make this possible? You may assume that both the planet and the platform do not move during this process.\end{problem}
