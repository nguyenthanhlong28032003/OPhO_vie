\begin{solution}
Let $N$ be the number of particles in the box as a function of time, and let $T_1$ be the temperature of the box as a function of time. Then effusion gives

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dt}=\frac{2AN}{V}\sqrt{\frac{k_BT_1}{2\pi m}}
\end{equation}

Typically there would be no factor of $2$ and $\frac{dN}{dt}$ would be negative, but $3$ new particles enter the box from the reservoir every time one leaves from the hole. \\
\\
We also know that energy leaves the box through the hole through the thermal energy of the leaving gas. A similar process happens to the gas entering from the reservoir. It can be shown that the average energy of a particle effusing out of a small hole is $2kT$, and since the particles coming in from the reservoir are also effusing in, this is the average energy of the incoming and outgoing particles. The rate of gas leaving is $\frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}$ and the rate of gas entering is $\frac{3}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}$, so

\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2}Nk_BT_1\right)&=\left(\frac{3}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\right)(2k_BT_2)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\right)(2k_BT_1)
\end{align}
    Simplifying yields 

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{dT_1}{dt}=\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt}\left(2T_2-
        \frac{5}{3}T_1\right)
    \end{equation}
    Plugging in for dN/dt yields

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{dT_1}{dt}=\frac{A}{V}\sqrt{\frac{k_BT_1}{2\pi m}}\left(4T_2-\frac{10}{3}T_1\right)
    \end{equation}
    Integrating this yields
    \begin{equation}
        t=(0.007524)\frac{V}{A}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi m}{k_B}}
    \end{equation}
    Which, plugging in the numbers, is 0.492 days.
