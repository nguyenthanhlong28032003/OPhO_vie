\begin{solution}
    Our constraint here is that 
    $$\int_{0}^{t} (\tau (\theta)-mgl\sin \theta) \, d\theta \geq 0$$
    for all $0\leq t \leq 90^{\circ}$. In other words, the cumulative energy input minus the work done by gravity should never be negative. Carrying out the integral and simplifying a bit, we get the following inequality:
    
    $$\frac{\tau_0}{2mgl}\geq\frac{1-\cos t}{t+\sin t}$$

    Between zero and ninety degrees, the function on the left-hand side is monotonically increasing. So, to find its maximum, evaluate it at $t=\pi/2$.

    Our answer is $\boxed{\tau_0=\frac{2}{1+\pi/2} mgl = 57.1\;\mathrm{N\cdot m}}$.
