\begin{solution}
If the setups was homogenous (conductivity wise), the conductance of the sheet would be simply
\[G=\sigma\frac Ad=\sigma t.\]
Thus the current drawn would simply be
\[I=GV=\sigma tV.\]
Now we need to just find the effective conductivity of the setup.\\

We consider the dual grid, which due to the grid-like structure is topologically equivalent. The dual-conductivities of the plates are now the inverses of the original ones and thus if the effective conductivity of the original sheet was $\sigma$, its dual-conductivity is $1/\sigma.$ But now we notice that the original conductivities can be recovered by multiplying all dual-conductivities by $100\times 10^{10}\;(\mathrm{S/m})^2.$ (The original 20-plate becomes a 5-plate and vice versa and the 10-plate stays the same). The grid was just rotated which doesn't change the current drawn. I.e. the grid is self-dual. Thus 
\[\sigma=\frac{100\times 10^{10}\;(\mathrm{S/m})^2}{\sigma} \implies \sigma=10\times10^5\;\mathrm{S/m}.\]
Hence
\[I\approx \boxed{26\;\mathrm{A}.}\]
