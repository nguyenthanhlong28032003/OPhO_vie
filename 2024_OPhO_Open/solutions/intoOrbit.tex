\begin{solution}

The minimal initial velocity necessary to enter orbit will occur when the semimajor axis is minimized. The semimajor axis is minimized when it is equivalent to $1.5R$.

By the vis-viva equation, the minimum velocity necessary to enter this orbit from the cannon launch is 

$$v = \sqrt{GM\bigg(\frac{2}{2R}-\frac{1}{a}\bigg)} = \sqrt{GM\bigg(\frac{1}{R}-\frac{1}{1.5R}\bigg)} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{3R}}$$

The cannonball must accelerate to this speed by the time it reaches the end of the barrel. The acceleration can thus be calculated:

$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$$

$$\bigg(\sqrt{\frac{GM}{3R}}\bigg)^2 = 2al\longrightarrow a = \frac{GM}{6Rl}$$

The minimal force is therefore:

$$ F = ma = \frac{GMm}{6Rl}\approx \boxed{1.67\times10^8\;\mathrm{N}}$$
