\begin{solution}
    The car's initial velocity is $v_0 =X/T$. Using $v^2 = 2 a \Delta x$, we find its acceleration is $a=\frac{X}{2T^2}$. Therefore, the distance the car travels in time $T$ is 

    $$v_0 T - \frac{1}{2} a T^2 = \frac{3}{4} X= 30.0 \ m$$

    You do not get hit by the car, and you are $\boxed{2.0 \ \mathrm{m}}$ away from the car when you finish crossing the street.
