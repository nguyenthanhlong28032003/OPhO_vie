\begin{solution}
Let the incoming neutron have Lorentz factor $\gamma$. Note that the total energy of the system is $E =(\gamma m_n + m_\alpha)c^2$ and the initial momentum satisfies $p^2 = (\gamma^2 - 1)m_n^2 c^2$. The total energy is minimized if the final protons and neutrons all have the same velocity, in which case the final mass of the system is $M=2m_p + 3m_n$. Thus, by energy and momentum conservation:
\begin{align*}E^2 &= p^2 c^2 + M^2 c^4\\ (\gamma^2 m_n^2 + 2\gamma m_n m_\alpha + m_\alpha ^2)c^4 &= (\gamma^2 - 1)m_n^2 c^4 + M^2 c^4\\ \gamma &= \frac{M^2 - m_n^2 - m_\alpha^2}{2m_n m_\alpha} = 1.0378\end{align*}
We find $v/c = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} = \boxed{0.267}$.
